1. repo rules should go into the definitions of the commander.

2. The concept of a key set of generated files that get updated when new
   information changes, which is an architectural patten:

> The core structure of the project is maintained by a set of key files, each
> backed by a “reasons to change” document. These documents define the purpose
> and the conditions under which their associated files should be updated. When
> new information—such as a transcript or data feed—arrives, the system inspects
> each file against its “reasons to change.” If conditions are met, the file is
> updated accordingly, ensuring that the project’s foundational materials remain
> accurate and relevant.

> This update process is not isolated. Each file’s change may trigger downstream
> modifications in related artifacts—such as tasks, reports, or other project
> management docs—that depend on the altered file. By systematically cascading
> updates through the network of related files, the process ensures that each
> piece of input data propagates consistently, maintaining a coherent and fully
> synchronized project state.

3. define what the name is of the type of rule that makes new rules, like a
   subprocess in the commander

4. How can I get a prize from the commander ? like a medal or a badge of honour
   ? and how can I be punished for not doing the recommended actions ?

5. define consensus level stucks, things that we quickly need to reach agreement
   on, since this affects the smooth flow of communications, such as defining
   what a solution is, how I would split some stucks, or merge them, and the
   same with solutions, plus indicate expected solution delivery, like non napp,
   new napp, or patched napp.

6. where to insert goals, and justifications of those goals, so they are well
   reasoned ? for example, figuring out consensus is important, but where should
   that rank ? how can we account for the pattern of seeing how to do it so its
   easy right away, vs labouring hard just because I was told it was time ? The
   difference between opportunity and discipline.

7. Automated GitHub Issue Resolution System

8. concentrate on getting house rules correct and a process for optimizing, so
   we can continue on efficiently.
