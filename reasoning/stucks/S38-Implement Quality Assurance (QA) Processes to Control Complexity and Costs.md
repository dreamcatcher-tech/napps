# Implement Quality Assurance (QA) Processes to Control Complexity and Costs

priority: TBD

## Situation

- Complexity and fast development risk quality and cost overruns.
- Need QA processes integrated into workflows.

## Background

- Without QA, errors accumulate, tech debt grows.
- QA ensures consistent standards.

## Done

- QA integrated, preventing regressions, ensuring code and decisions remain
  sound.

### Evals

- Check code quality metrics, defect rates.
- Validate reduced rework and stable deployments.

## Assessment

### Capabilities

- Automated testing, code reviews, performance checks.

### Inputs & Trigger Conditions

- Triggered at code commit, release preparation.
- Inputs: Code diffs, test suites, performance logs.

### Expected Behaviour

- Consistent, high-quality outputs despite complexity.

### Key Functionalities

- CI/CD integration, test coverage reports, QA gating.

### Potential Impact

- Lower defect rates, controlled costs, better user experience.

### Constraints

#### Known Limitations

- Requires stable main repo and task structures.

#### Unknown Limitations

- QA tools may need refinement as complexity grows.

## Current Situation

### Cost

- TBD

#### Effort Expended

- Initial QA concepts identified.

#### Future Estimate

- 1-2 sprints to implement basic QA pipelines.

### Progress

- Ready to integrate once tasks and structures are stable.

## Recommendation

- Implement QA early to prevent accumulation of technical debt.
- Expand test coverage incrementally.
