# Implement Robust Task ("Stuck") Structure with Estimates and Retrospectives

## Situation

- Need a clear way to represent tasks (stucks) with time estimates and
  retrospectives.
- Improves forecasting and continuous improvement.

## Background

- As complexity grows, structured task management is crucial.
- Retrospectives help learn from past efforts.

## Done

- Tasks defined as stucks, each with estimates and a retrospective mechanism.

### Evals

- Validate accuracy of estimates over time.
- Check if retrospectives lead to better planning.

## Assessment

### Capabilities

- Formal task representation, time estimation, post-completion reviews.

### Inputs & Trigger Conditions

- Triggered when adding or completing tasks.
- Inputs: Task details, historical data, outcomes.

### Expected Behaviour

- Clear visibility into workload, timelines, and lessons learned.

### Key Functionalities

- Task creation, estimate logging, retrospective recording.

### Potential Impact

- Better predictability, improved team efficiency, continuous improvement.

### Constraints

#### Known Limitations

- Requires stable schema for stucks.

#### Unknown Limitations

- Estimation accuracy improves as system matures.

## Current Situation

### Cost

- TBD

#### Effort Expended

- Conceptual stage.

#### Future Estimate

- 1 sprint to implement initial structure.

### Progress

- Requirements understood, waiting on knowledge structure completion.

## Recommendation

- Implement once knowledge structures are set.
- Start with simple estimation methods and refine.
