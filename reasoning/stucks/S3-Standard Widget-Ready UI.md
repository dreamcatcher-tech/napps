# Standard Widget-Ready UI

priority: 3

## Situation

- Current UI template is Markdown-centric; need a generic widget architecture
  for flexible UI components.

## Background

- To present data and tools (e.g., search), the UI must handle standard widgets
  easily.

## Done

- The UI can dynamically load and display widgets beyond simple Markdown,
  enabling a modular front-end.

### Evals

- Verify multiple widget types render correctly, test adding/removing widgets
  without UI breakage.

## Assessment

### Capabilities

- Load different widget components, manage their state, position, and
  interactions.

### Inputs & Trigger Conditions

- Triggered on UI load or user action adding a widget.

### Expected Behaviour

- Seamless widget inclusion and interaction on the dashboard.

### Key Functionalities

- Widget container, lifecycle management, rendering pipeline.

### Potential Impact

- Accelerates adding new features without refactoring UI code.

### Constraints

#### Known Limitations

- Dependent on stable front-end framework integrations.

#### Unknown Limitations

- Performance under heavy widget load.

## Current Situation

### Cost

- Moderate-high due to refactoring and testing.

#### Effort Expended

- Initial experiments with widget components.

#### Future Estimate

- 1-2 sprints to polish and integrate fully.

### Progress

- Conceptual design done, initial code prototype started.

## Recommendation

- Finalize a widget API, test with simple widget examples, iterate until stable.
