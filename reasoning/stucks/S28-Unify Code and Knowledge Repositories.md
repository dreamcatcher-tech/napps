# Unify Code and Knowledge Repositories

## Situation

- Multiple repos cause fragmentation.
- Need a single repository for consistent version control and QA.
- References: (26:09, 28:16), (39:54)

## Background

- Scattered data hardens complexity.
- A single repo simplifies integration, referencing, and management.

## Done

- All code and knowledge in one repository, easy to navigate and maintain.

### Evals

- Check if team can find resources quickly.
- Validate CI/CD pipelines run smoothly in the unified repo.

## Assessment

### Capabilities

- Centralized version control, simpler QA, streamlined development.

### Inputs & Trigger Conditions

- Triggered by current repo fragmentation.
- Inputs: Existing code and docs from multiple repos.

### Expected Behaviour

- One-stop-shop repo for all project elements.

### Key Functionalities

- Consolidated structure, uniform branching, easier merges.

### Potential Impact

- Reduced confusion, faster onboarding, improved collaboration.

### Constraints

#### Known Limitations

- Migration effort required.

#### Unknown Limitations

- Potential reorganization as project grows.

## Current Situation

### Cost

- TBD

#### Effort Expended

- Initial planning.

#### Future Estimate

- 1-2 sprints to migrate and reorganize.

### Progress

- Ready to proceed once stuck structures are stable.

## Recommendation

- Unify repos after task structure is established.
- Ensure a well-defined folder and branch structure.
