# Stuck Graph Visualization

priority: 14

## Situation

- Desire a visual map of stucks as nodes and edges.

## Background

- Helps understand complex dependencies among stucks/solutions.

## Done

- A force-directed graph shows stucks and connections.

### Evals

- Test rendering performance, user navigation, accuracy of links.

## Assessment

### Capabilities

- Graphical visualization, node/edge definitions, tooltips.

### Inputs & Trigger Conditions

- Triggered by user selecting “map view.”

### Expected Behaviour

- Interactive, zoomable graph.

### Key Functionalities

- Graph rendering, dependency mapping.

### Potential Impact

- Faster comprehension, better decisions.

### Constraints

#### Known Limitations

- Performance for large graphs.

#### Unknown Limitations

- Requires fully defined stuck dependencies.

## Current Situation

### Cost

- Moderate; need graph libs and stable data.

#### Effort Expended

- None yet.

#### Future Estimate

- 1-2 sprints once data stable.

### Progress

- Conceptual only.

## Recommendation

- Wait until stuck structure stable, then implement prototype graph.
