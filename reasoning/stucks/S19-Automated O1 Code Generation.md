# Automated O1 Code Generation

priority: 19

## Situation

- Currently manually integrating O1 outputs. Need to automate the pipeline.

## Background

- Saves time, reduces error, no manual copy/paste.

## Done

- O1 outputs directly produce code changes and commits automatically.

### Evals

- Validate generated code compiles/runs, check commit correctness.

## Assessment

### Capabilities

- Integrate O1 model output with version control.

### Inputs & Trigger Conditions

- Triggered by O1 commands.

### Expected Behaviour

- Auto-committed code, no manual step.

### Key Functionalities

- O1 integration, code formatting, automated commits.

### Potential Impact

- Speeds dev, reduces tedious tasks.

### Constraints

#### Known Limitations

- Bad O1 output = bad code.

#### Unknown Limitations

- Complex refactors need human review.

## Current Situation

### Cost

- Moderate; scripting and pipelines needed.

#### Effort Expended

- Initial attempts.

#### Future Estimate

- 1-2 sprints stable pipeline.

### Progress

- Early prototypes done.

## Recommendation

- Add safeguards/tests, automate simple tasks first, expand as confidence grows.
