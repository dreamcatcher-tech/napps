## Situation

- Need a tool to manage and summarize domain files.
- Facilitates better context management for O1 Pro.
- References: (45:50–46:40)

## Background

- Large context windows difficult to manage manually.
- Concat tool helps create condensed summaries of domain-specific files.

## Done

- Concat tool operational, integrated with workflow, providing summaries on
  demand.

### Evals

- Validate tool output correctness and relevance.
- Check if it improves O1 Pro’s reasoning efficiency.

## Assessment

### Capabilities

- Summarizes files/folders, reduces noise, highlights key points.

### Inputs & Trigger Conditions

- Triggered by user or Commander requests.
- Inputs: Source files/directories.

### Expected Behaviour

- Reliable, coherent summaries available for O1 Pro.

### Key Functionalities

- File scanning, summary generation, storage of summary outputs.

### Potential Impact

- Faster reasoning, reduced token consumption, clearer context.

### Constraints

#### Known Limitations

- Depends on stable knowledge structures.

#### Unknown Limitations

- Quality of summaries may vary with file complexity.

## Current Situation

### Cost

- TBD

#### Effort Expended

- Tool concept known, needs deployment.

#### Future Estimate

- <1 sprint to integrate tool once basic infrastructure is ready.

### Progress

- Awaiting stable environment.

## Recommendation

- Deploy after Commander and knowledge structures are in place.
- Test on sample files before production use.
