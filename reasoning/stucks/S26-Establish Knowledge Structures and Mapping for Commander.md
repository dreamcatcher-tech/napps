# Establish Knowledge Structures and Mapping for Commander

## Situation

- Commander needs well-defined knowledge frameworks.
- Must manage data, tasks, dependencies in a structured format.
- References: (33:07, 34:40, 39:54, 42:05, 44:50)

## Background

- Without structured knowledge, Commander can’t reason effectively.
- Hierarchical and graph-based structures are required.

## Done

- Knowledge structures in place, enabling Commander to navigate and reason about
  data.

### Evals

- Validate that Commander can locate and use relevant information efficiently.
- Check performance on complex queries.

## Assessment

### Capabilities

- Organizing tasks, stucks, and solutions into a knowledge graph.
- Providing quick retrieval and contextual linking.

### Inputs & Trigger Conditions

- Triggered during Commander’s reasoning processes.
- Inputs: Stuck definitions, project metadata, documentation.

### Expected Behaviour

- Commander can answer questions, find dependencies, and support
  decision-making.

### Key Functionalities

- Hierarchical storage, indexing, referencing multiple data sources.

### Potential Impact

- Enhanced clarity, reduced confusion, faster decision-making.

### Constraints

#### Known Limitations

- Depends on stable formats and schemas.

#### Unknown Limitations

- Adapting the structure as project evolves.

## Current Situation

### Cost

- TBD

#### Effort Expended

- Conceptual design in progress.

#### Future Estimate

- 1-2 sprints to establish initial structures.

### Progress

- Preliminary schema proposals.

## Recommendation

- Implement after Commander’s basic framework exists.
- Refine iteratively as project scales.
