### Evals

- Test queries against known stuck sets, validate speed/accuracy.

## Assessment

### Capabilities

- Indexed search over stuck/solution data.

### Inputs & Trigger Conditions

- Triggered by user input in search field.

### Key Functionalities

- Similar logic to customer search, different dataset.

### Potential Impact

- Faster project management, quicker reference to issues/fixes.

### Constraints

#### Known Limitations

- Depends on stable stuck storage.

#### Unknown Limitations

- Handling large sets of stucks.

## Current Situation

### Cost

- Low; reuse existing widget logic.

#### Effort Expended

- Concept only.

#### Future Estimate

- <1 sprint once stuck data stable.

### Progress

- Pending stuck data integration.

## Recommendation
