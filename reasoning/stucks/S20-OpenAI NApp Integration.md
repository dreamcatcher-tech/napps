# OpenAI NApp Integration

priority: 20

## Situation

- Need a NApp to interface with OpenAI models, allowing text prompts/tool usage.

## Background

- Adds intelligent reasoning and content generation capabilities.

## Done

- NApp can send prompts to OpenAI, get responses, integrate tools.

### Evals

- Test queries, measure response quality, tool usage correctness.

## Assessment

### Capabilities

- Prompt OpenAI, parse responses, integrate tools.

### Inputs & Trigger Conditions

- Triggered by user/NApp request.

### Expected Behaviour

- Coherent answers, effective tool calls.

### Key Functionalities

- OpenAI API calls, result parsing, error handling.

### Potential Impact

- Adds powerful AI features.

### Constraints

#### Known Limitations

- Costs, latency.

#### Unknown Limitations

- Future OpenAI API changes.

## Current Situation

### Cost

- Moderate; known OpenAI integration patterns.

#### Effort Expended

- Some testing with APIs.

#### Future Estimate

- 1 sprint basic version.

### Progress

- Prototyping begun.

## Recommendation

- Implement minimal OpenAI NApp, test basic prompts, expand tool usage later.
