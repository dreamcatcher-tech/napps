# Allocate Resources Based on Value Units

## Situation

- Introduce “value units” (e.g., tokens) to prioritize tasks.
- Efficient resource allocation by importance and impact.
- References: (32:49)

## Background

- Without a priority system, risk of misallocating resources.
- Value units quantify task importance.

## Done

- Value units system in place, guiding resource distribution to high-impact
  tasks.

### Evals

- Check if priority aligns with project goals.
- Validate that tasks with higher value units get done first.

## Assessment

### Capabilities

- Ranking tasks by strategic importance.
- More rational decision-making on what to do next.

### Inputs & Trigger Conditions

- Triggered when scheduling tasks or choosing next steps.
- Inputs: Task importance metrics, strategic objectives.

### Expected Behaviour

- High-value tasks always addressed first.
- Efficient token usage and reduced waste.

### Key Functionalities

- Value assignment, sorting, and resource tracking.

### Potential Impact

- Better strategic outcomes, improved ROI.

### Constraints

#### Known Limitations

- Requires stable Commander and NApp execution environment.

#### Unknown Limitations

- May need tuning as strategy evolves.

## Current Situation

### Cost

- TBD

#### Effort Expended

- Conceptual only.

#### Future Estimate

- 1 sprint after Commander is stable.

### Progress

- Awaiting foundational components.

## Recommendation

- Implement once Commander can use these metrics.
- Start simple and refine weighting system over time.
