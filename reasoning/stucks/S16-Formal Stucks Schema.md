# Formal Stucks Schema

priority: 16

## Situation

- Stucks currently ad-hoc; need a formal structure.

## Background

- Ensures machine-readable, consistent stuck definitions.

## Done

- A stable schema for stucks (fields, dependencies, statuses).

### Evals

- Validate sample stucks against the schema, check no ambiguity.

## Assessment

### Capabilities

- Defined fields, easy parsing, querying.

### Inputs & Trigger Conditions

- Triggered when creating/updating stucks.

### Expected Behaviour

- Conformity to one schema.

### Key Functionalities

- Field validation, schema versioning.

### Potential Impact

- Enables search, visualization, management tools.

### Constraints

#### Known Limitations

- Future migrations may be needed.

#### Unknown Limitations

- Edge cases.

## Current Situation

### Cost

- Moderate; similar to NApp schema work.

#### Effort Expended

- Discussions ongoing.

#### Future Estimate

- 1 sprint to finalize initial schema.

### Progress

- Early draft proposed.

## Recommendation

- Align with NApp schema, finalize stuck schema, test with known stuck set.
