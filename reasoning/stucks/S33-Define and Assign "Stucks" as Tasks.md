- Clarify hierarchical task structure.
- References: (20:02, 25:02)

## Background

- “Stucks” emerged as a concept for tasks; must formalize their use.
- A unified naming and structure reduces confusion.

## Done

- All tasks represented as stucks with a standardized format.

### Evals

- Check if team uniformly uses stucks and finds them intuitive.
- Validate that Commander interprets stucks correctly.

## Assessment

### Capabilities

- Uniform task representation, no unnecessary distinctions.

### Inputs & Trigger Conditions

- Triggered at task creation or retrieval.
- Inputs: Task details, parent-child relationships.

### Expected Behaviour

- Consistent, predictable task definitions improve tool usage and planning.

### Key Functionalities

- Stuck creation, linking, updating in a standard format.

### Potential Impact

- Simpler management, better automation, improved collaboration.

### Constraints

#### Known Limitations

- Requires the previous stuck management infrastructure.

#### Unknown Limitations

- May refine stuck schema over time.

## Current Situation

### Cost

- TBD

#### Effort Expended

- Concept stage.

#### Future Estimate

- <1 sprint to formalize once prerequisites are met.

### Progress

- Concept ready, waiting on dependencies.

## Recommendation

- Define stuck format clearly.
- Document guidelines and train team.
