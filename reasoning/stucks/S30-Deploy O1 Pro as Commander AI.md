### Inputs & Trigger Conditions

- Triggered by project demands, user queries.
- Inputs: Project state, stuck definitions, resource data.

### Expected Behaviour

- Proactively manage tasks, call tools, propose solutions.

### Key Functionalities

- Tool calls, reasoning steps, structured outputs.

### Potential Impact

- Enhanced autonomy, scaling without linear human effort.

### Constraints

#### Known Limitations

- Requires stable Commander and tool integration.

#### Unknown Limitations

- May need fine-tuning prompts for best results.

## Current Situation

### Cost

- TBD

#### Effort Expended

- Preliminary integration ideas only.

#### Future Estimate

- Several sprints after infrastructure is ready.

### Progress

- Planning phase.

## Recommendation

- Integrate O1 Pro after Commander and concat tool are operational.
