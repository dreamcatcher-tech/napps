# Develop Module Mapping System

## Situation

- Multi-package projects need a system to manage modules in NApps.
- Seamless integration and navigation required.
- References: (21:00)

## Background

- Complex projects split into modules/packages.
- Need a system to track and integrate them.

## Done

- Module mapping system implemented, enabling easy navigation and integration of
  packages.

### Evals

- Validate that developers and Commander can find and integrate modules easily.
- Check if this reduces integration errors.

## Assessment

### Capabilities

- Identify modules, their functions, and dependencies.
- Provide a map for Commander to select appropriate modules.

### Inputs & Trigger Conditions

- Triggered by building or executing NApps.
- Inputs: Module definitions, code repositories.

### Expected Behaviour

- Smooth integration of multi-package projects.

### Key Functionalities

- Module registry, dependency mapping, version tracking.

### Potential Impact

- Faster development, fewer integration issues, scalable architecture.

### Constraints

#### Known Limitations

- Requires stable stuck/task structures and Commander.

#### Unknown Limitations

- Might need adaptation as modules grow in number.

## Current Situation

### Cost

- TBD

#### Effort Expended

- Concept phase.

#### Future Estimate

- 1 sprint after task structures stabilized.

### Progress

- Awaiting prerequisites.

## Recommendation

- Implement once stucks and Commander are well-defined.
- Start with a few modules and scale up.
