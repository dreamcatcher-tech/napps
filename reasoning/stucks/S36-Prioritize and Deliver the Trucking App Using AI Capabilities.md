## Background

- Now that pipeline and tools are improving, must leverage them to deliver
  quickly.

## Done

- Trucking app delivered, faster and cheaper using advanced AI coding tools.

### Evals

- Compare delivery speed, cost, and quality to previous methods.
- Confirm client satisfaction and revenue impact.

## Assessment

### Capabilities

- Faster coding cycles, automated testing, improved resource allocation.

### Inputs & Trigger Conditions

- Triggered by finalizing pipeline and tool integration.
- Inputs: Client specs, AI coding environment.

### Expected Behaviour

- Rapid development and deployment with minimal human overhead.

### Key Functionalities

- Automated code generation, QA integration, continuous delivery.

### Potential Impact

- Boost immediate revenue, showcase AI-driven capabilities.

### Constraints

#### Known Limitations

- Relies on previously established stuck structures and tools.

#### Unknown Limitations

- Client may request features beyond initial scope.

## Current Situation

### Cost

- TBD

#### Effort Expended

- Planning in tandem with AI pipeline improvements.

#### Future Estimate

- Very short once tools are ready.

### Progress

- Awaiting tool and pipeline readiness.

## Recommendation

- Execute as soon as AI pipeline is confirmed stable.
- Deliver quickly, get client feedback, iterate.
