# Map Tasks, Dependencies, and Risks

## Situation

- Complex project with many tasks requires clear dependency mapping.
- Identify risks to allocate resources effectively.
- References: (19:04, 26:09, 28:16)

## Background

- Without a task graph, complexity leads to confusion.
- Risk assessment improves strategic decisions.

## Done

- Comprehensive task map with dependencies and identified risks.

### Evals

- Validate that Commander can navigate and prioritize tasks.
- Check if risk-aware decisions improve outcomes.

## Assessment

### Capabilities

- Visualizing task chains, highlighting risk areas.
- Informing Commanderâ€™s decisions.

### Inputs & Trigger Conditions

- Triggered when planning or adjusting timelines.
- Inputs: Task list, known dependencies, risk factors.

### Expected Behaviour

- Commander easily sees which tasks block others and manages them accordingly.

### Key Functionalities

- Dependency graphs, risk scoring, dynamic updates.

### Potential Impact

- Reduced blind spots, proactive mitigation strategies.

### Constraints

#### Known Limitations

- Requires stable stuck/task structure.

#### Unknown Limitations

- Risk models may evolve over time.

## Current Situation

### Cost

- TBD

#### Effort Expended

- Conceptual phase.

#### Future Estimate

- 1 sprint after Commander is fully functional.

### Progress

- Awaiting foundational structures.

## Recommendation

- Implement after main Commander functionalities are stable.
- Start with a simple dependency map and refine.
