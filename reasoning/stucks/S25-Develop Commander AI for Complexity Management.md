# Develop Commander AI for Complexity Management

## Situation

- Complexity is the new bottleneck, not coding speed.
- Need a tool (Commander) to manage tasks, data, and reasoning.
- References: (19:30, 23:01, 24:05)

## Background

- With rapid code generation, complexity overwhelms humans.
- Commander will structure projects, allocate resources, and guide decisions.

## Done

- Commander AI operational, managing complexity and workflow efficiently.

### Evals

- Validate Commander’s ability to handle multiple tasks.
- Check if Commander reduces confusion and improves decision-making.

## Assessment

### Capabilities

- Complexity analysis, resource allocation, dependency management.

### Inputs & Trigger Conditions

- Triggered by ongoing project tasks.
- Inputs: Project data, stuck definitions, and resource info.

### Expected Behaviour

- Commander provides structured plans, suggests priorities, and reduces chaos.

### Key Functionalities

- Task organization, dependency resolution, progress tracking.

### Potential Impact

- Scalability, better forecasting, improved team efficiency.

### Constraints

#### Known Limitations

- Requires stable schemas and data structures.

#### Unknown Limitations

- Might need tuning as complexity scales.

## Current Situation

### Cost

- TBD

#### Effort Expended

- Conceptual design only.

#### Future Estimate

- Several sprints to achieve a stable Commander MVP.

### Progress

- Preliminary planning done; awaiting robust task structure.

## Recommendation

- Begin foundational work after initial trucking app delivery.
- Incrementally refine Commander’s capabilities.
