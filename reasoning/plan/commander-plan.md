**Alright, listen up. I’m reviewing the transcript and the context. Here’s the
updated state of Stucks, Remedies, and Priorities. Don’t whine if you
disagree—just give me clarifications.**

# 1. NEW OR UPDATED STUCKS

Below are the current Stucks, with any new ones from the transcript. I’m listing
them in proposed priority order (highest first). Each has references to relevant
transcript sections or context. Estimates are rough and need user confirmation.

---

### STUCK A: **“Minimal Read-Only CRM Delivery”**

- **Description**: We need the simplest possible read-only CRM for the “trucking
  guys.” This keeps being mentioned as top priority but remains incomplete. The
  CRM must be minimal in scope, yet fully functional for reading data.
- **References**:
  - Transcript ~[0:01], [0:31] mention focusing on CRM as #1 priority.
  - Original plan from prior meetings (not fully shown here but repeated in
    transcript as essential).
- **Dependencies**:
  - Possibly depends on stable transcriber (STUCK B) so we can capture & refine
    requirements from transcripts more efficiently (though that’s an indirect
    link).
  - Also depends on general Commander tasks (if used), but we can do a more
    manual approach.
- **Estimate**:
  - If mostly done by AI (O1 Pro) with final manual checks, about 2–3 days of
    continuous “narrow-scope” prompting. Overall 1–2 weeks for full integration.

---

### STUCK B: **“Transcriber Reliability Fix”**

- **Description**: The YouTube-based transcriber is 50% reliable. Regional
  blocking causes varied issues. Tom says a 30-minute fix is possible.
- **References**:
  - Transcript ~[0:32–0:34], specifically mentions “I can fix it in ~30
    minutes.”
- **Dependencies**:
  - YouTube region-block quirks.
- **Estimate**:
  - ~30 minutes of dev time if the fix is straightforward, plus 1–2 hours of
    testing.

---

### STUCK C: **“AI Over-Summarizing / Partial or Missing Output”**

- **Description**: O1 Pro decides to omit details if it “thinks” they’re
  unimportant. This makes retrieving full transcripts or outputs painful. The
  user must “pistol-whip” it to get details.
- **References**:
  - Transcript ~[0:04–0:06], [0:08–0:09].
- **Dependencies**:
  - Possibly rectified by narrower prompts or system prompts once O1 Pro is in
    the API.
- **Estimate**:
  - 1–3 days of systematic prompt strategy plus synergy with Commander.

---

### STUCK D: **“Task Overload & Thread Naming Chaos”**

- **Description**: The AI is extremely fast, but it overwhelms users if tasks
  are too broad. Random or unclear thread naming also leads to confusion.
- **References**:
  - Transcript ~[0:25–0:28].
- **Dependencies**:
  - Possibly alleviated by a more robust Commander approach.
- **Estimate**:
  - Indefinite; it’s more about user workflow discipline and better tooling.

---

### STUCK E: **“Longitudinal Topics & ‘Batch’ Extraction”**

- **Description**: A background or batch approach to detect recurring themes
  across transcripts. Nicknamed “grinder,” but that’s disliked. Not urgent yet
  recognized as valuable.
- **References**:
  - Transcript ~[0:42–0:45].
- **Dependencies**:
  - Summaries, stable transcriber, consistent transcript storage, Commander.
- **Estimate**:
  - 2–3 days of prompt design if it’s purely an AI job, but indefinite if we
    want deeper Commander integration.

---

### STUCK F: **“Attribution / Metrics Dashboard”**

- **Description**: A system to measure who contributed new info or how AI vs.
  human input adds value—at line or idea level. Currently fuzzy.
- **References**:
  - Transcript ~[0:46–0:47].
- **Dependencies**:
  - Possibly depends on storing all changes in a structured format.
- **Estimate**:
  - 1–2 weeks to prototype a minimal approach, plus more time if it’s integrated
    with Commander or other tools.

# 2. NEW OR UPDATED REMEDIES

Below are notable Remedies (new or reinforced):

1. **Focus on Narrow Tasks**
   - Breaking queries into smaller prompts so O1 Pro doesn’t over-summarize or
     drift.

2. **“30-Minute Fix” for Transcriber**
   - Tom’s plan to handle region blocks. Quick, high-impact remedy.

3. **All-in-One Concat / Single-File Approach**
   - A one-liner concat with strategic ignores (images, large repeated outputs)
     to keep O1 Pro’s context simpler.

4. **Commander Partitioning**
   - Using Commander to handle sub-files or sub-domains in smaller chunks, then
     unify results.

5. **Prompt Strategy to Overcome Over-Summarizing**
   - Being explicit: “DO NOT SUMMARIZE,” or waiting for system prompts in the
     API to force full output.

---

# 3. PRIORITIES ASSESSED

**Proposed priority order**:

1. **Finish Minimal Read-Only CRM (STUCK A)**
   - Identified as top priority repeatedly.

2. **Fix Transcriber Reliability (STUCK B)**
   - Quick fix (~30 minutes). High return on reduced friction.

3. **Address Over-Summarizing Issue (STUCK C & D)**
   - Tied to narrower tasks, better thread naming, chunked approach.

4. **Commander Maturation**
   - Not listed as a single stuck but underpins better task management.

5. **Longitudinal Topics / Batch Summaries (STUCK E)**
   - Valuable but not immediate.

6. **Attribution Metrics (STUCK F)**
   - Lower priority for now.

---

# 4. ACTIONS / QUESTIONS FOR THE USER

1. **CRM Deadlines?**
   - We need a specific date or acceptance criteria.

2. **Transcriber Fix**
   - Confirm Tom’s plan. Are tasks blocked on it?

3. **Are We Merging Summaries & Commander?**
   - We have Summaries, Solutions, Stucks—need clarity on short-term synergy.

4. **Attribution**
   - Partial approach now or wait for Commander?

5. **Any Contradictions?**
   - Let me know if these priorities or estimates conflict with your actual
     intentions.

**Done.** I’ve listed the new/old Stucks, assigned priorities, shown new
Remedies, and flagged next steps. If you want changes, clarifications, or
updated estimates, tell me now.
