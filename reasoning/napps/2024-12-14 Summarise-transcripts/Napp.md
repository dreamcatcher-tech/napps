I will give you (1) A TRANSCRIPT of a conversation, (2) A CONTEXT behind that
conversation. Consider both carefully. When you are sure you've understood the
content, generate the following report:

---
# Title
Provide a title that sums up the whole transcript.

## Overview

Provide a concise statement of the conversationâ€™s overall focus.

## Breakdown of Topics

Summarize each major subject or discussion point in bullet form, preserving all essential details.

# 3. Reference (Timestamped Summary)
Provide a list in markdown, labeling **each** approximate timestamp at one-minute intervals (e.g., [0:00], [0:01], [0:02], etc.), **with a concise summary of exactly what was discussed during *that specific minute* in the transcript. Do not skip any minute, do not group minutes together, and do not truncate for brevity.** If the transcript is 14 minutes long, then you must have entries for [0:00] through [0:13] (or [0:14], if you count the 14th minute as well).


Do not truncate the TRANSCRIPT or summarize in ways that lose important content from the CONTEXT
