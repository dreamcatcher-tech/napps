# Solution

**Definition**: A proposed approach or set of actions that addresses (fully or
partially) one or more [Stucks](stuck.md) or introduces a beneficial outcome
even if no specific stuck has been identified. A “solution” is conceptual, often
preceding or complementing tangible artifacts like [NApps](napp.md).

## Description

A solution can exist purely at the idea stage (e.g., a conceptual improvement
plan) or can evolve into a fully implemented artifact (such as a code module, a
new policy, or a [NApp](napp.md)). A single Stuck can have multiple proposed
solutions, and a single solution may address multiple or zero Stucks if it
provides new capabilities or seizes an “opportunity” not directly mapped to an
existing problem.

**Key Characteristics**:

- **Conceptual Proposal**: Details how a problem or unmet need might be
  resolved, or how a new opportunity could be realized.
- **Independence**: May stand alone without linking to a known Stuck, especially
  if it introduces novel functionality.
- **Potential for Implementation**: Can become a project plan, code, or a formal
  deliverable if accepted by relevant Actors or AI decision-makers (like the
  Commander).
- **Evolution into NApps**: Once validated or actively developed, solutions can
  be packaged as [NApps](napp.md), representing the tangible implementation of
  the idea.

**Relationship to Stucks**:

- **One-to-Many**: A single Stuck can have numerous candidate solutions.
- **Zero-to-Many**: A solution may solve zero, one, or multiple Stucks; it can
  also be an “opportunity” solution that introduces entirely new features.

## Examples

1. **Add a Slack integration to automate notifications**
   - Proposed to address a Stuck where users miss important system alerts; can
     also create new interactions not previously requested.

2. **New “Gamification” Feature**
   - May not correspond to a direct Stuck but offers potential engagement
     benefits, representing an “opportunity” solution.

## Importance

Documenting solutions separately from Stucks ensures that:

- **All Ideas are Captured**: Even when they don’t map to a current problem,
  they might prove valuable later.
- **Decision Clarity**: Facilitates evaluation by the Commander or project
  stakeholders for feasibility, priority, and potential ROI.
- **Traceable Outcomes**: Links between solutions and Stucks provide a clear
  path from problem statement to final implementation (if any).
